# Downloading Strava data

I've been using Strava for a while now to track my cycling. I've been using it for so long that I've got a lot of data in there. I've been meaning to download it for a while, but never got around to it. I finally got around to it today.

## Downloading the data

Strava has a [data export tool](https://www.strava.com/athlete/delete_your_account) that allows you to download all your data. It's pretty easy to use, just click the button and wait for the email. The email will contain a link to download a zip file containing all your data. The zip file is pretty big, mine was 1.5 GB.

## Unzipping the data

The zip file contains a bunch of files and folders. The most important one is the `activities` folder. This folder contains all the data for each activity. The files are named with the activity id, and are in the `gpx` format. The `gpx` format is an XML format for GPS data. It's a pretty common format, and can be used in a lot of different applications.

## Converting the data

I wanted to convert the `gpx` files to `fit` files. The `fit` format is a binary format that is used by Garmin devices. I wanted to convert the files because I wanted to use the data in [GoldenCheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org/). GoldenCheetah is an open source application for analyzing cycling data. It's a pretty powerful application, and I've been using it for a while now. It's got a lot of features, and I'm still learning how to use it.
