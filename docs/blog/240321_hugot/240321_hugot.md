> The goal of this library is to provide an easy, scalable, and hassle-free way to run huggingface transformer pipelines in golang applications.

Let's see how easy it is (on Mac).

## Installation

1. Getting the tokenizers

```
git clone https://github.com/Knights-Analytics/tokenizers -b main && \
cd tokenizers && \
cargo build --release
mv target/release/libtokenizers.a /usr/lib/libtokenizers.a
```

but rust was not updated, so I ran `rustup update` and then the above commands. But instead got `mv: fastcopy: open() failed (to): /usr/lib/libtokenizers.a: Operation not permitted`. This is because of SIP (System Integrity Protection) on Mac. So, let's try to instead move it to `/usr/local/lib`.

At the same time, I realized I just ran the `cargo build --release` command, but I'm not sure if that built it for the right architecture. So, I'll instead download the pre-built binary from the releases page of [github.com/daulet/tokenizers](https://github.com/daulet/tokenizers/releases). I downloaded the ` libtokenizers.darwin-arm64.tar.gz` for my M2 Max, untared it, and moved it with (which I needed `sudo` for).

2. Getting the ONNX runtime

I downloaded the `onnxruntime-osx-arm64-1.17.1.tgz` from the [ONNX runtime releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases), untared it, and moved `libonnxruntime.1.17.1.dylib` to `/usr/local/lib` and renamed it to `libonnxruntime.dylib`.

```bash
sudo cp ~/Downloads/onnxruntime-osx-arm64-1.17.1/lib/libonnxruntime.1.17.1.dylib /usr/local/lib/libonnxruntime.dylib
```
